KonversationHACKMit - A facebook app.

This project is the result of the collaboration between Alex Lenail, Tyler Lubeck, and Todd Pollak at HackMIT, October 5-6 2013. 

You know how you have some friends on facebook which you have massive, and I mean massive chat logs with? Have you ever tried scrolling up to find something in that conversation? It's a finger-workout, and that's what Konversation seeks to fix.
